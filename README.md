# ðŸš€ DSA Journey with GFG

This repository is a collection of my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice solutions, inspired by problems on **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**.  
The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills, build a strong foundation, and get ready for coding interviews.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Solve problems consistently and track progress.  
- Write clean, optimized, and well-documented code.  
- Improve logical thinking and time complexity analysis.  
- Build confidence for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ”¥ Motivation
_"One step at a time, one problem at a time."_  
Letâ€™s crack DSA together ðŸš€
